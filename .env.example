# Database connection for Prisma. When using docker-compose, use the db service name
DATABASE_URL="mysql://pos_user:pos_password@db:3306/pos_db"

# MySQL root password and user if you want compose to set them (optional)
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
MYSQL_DATABASE=pos_db
MYSQL_USER=pos_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=pos_password

# App settings
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# Optional: any other env variables your app expects

# ==================================================================
# Example: connect to an external MySQL host (you run MySQL separately)
# Replace <PASSWORD> with the real root/user password and adjust DB name
# If your DB is at IP 72.60.76.151 and you want to connect as root:
#
# DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:<PASSWORD>@72.60.76.151:3306/pos_db"
#
# Notes:
# - Ensure MySQL is configured to accept remote connections (bind-address, firewall).
# - If connecting as `root`, make sure the user has remote access privileges:
#     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pos_db.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
# - Open port 3306 in firewall (ufw or cloud provider security group) or restrict access to your app host IP.
# - When using an external DB, keep the `db` service in `docker-compose.yml` commented out or remove it,
#   and set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly in your deployed `.env` file.
